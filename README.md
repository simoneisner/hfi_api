# Project Title

HFI Hockey Pool Api

## Getting Started

This is the back end of the HFI Fantasy Hockey Pool App.  The API connects to nhl.com, gets data and converts it to objects used by the front end.  The API is currently still in under construction.  Most of the data retrieval is done.  Next step is securing the API with OAuth 2.
